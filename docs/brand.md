# Filare Brand Identity

## Core Meaning

- Filare speaks to twisting, threading, weaving, wiring, bundling, and assembling — a natural fit for harnesses and configuration wiring.
- Linguistic roots: Latin _filum_ (thread); Italian/Spanish _filare_ (to spin/thread); French _fil_ (wire).

## Positioning

- Tagline: “Where structures come together.”
- Promise: A tool ecosystem for building, weaving, generating, and validating complex harnesses — physical or digital.

## Brand Pillars

- **Structure** — Tools for building well-bundled systems, wiring, and harnesses.
- **Craftsmanship** — Clean, elegant, reproducible weave.
- **Precision** — Everything lines up mechanically, logically, electrically.
- **Weave & Flow** — Filare pulls threads into a coherent whole.
- **Industrial + Artisanal** — Technical yet handcrafted.
- **Modularity** — Many threads; one harness.

## Visual Identity

- **Palette**: Deep Indigo `#3C3C8D`, Electric Teal `#3BC9B0`, Soft Gray `#E3E3E3`, Dark Graphite `#1A1A1C`, optional Copper accent `#C57F39`.
- **Typography**: Inter, Space Grotesk, or IBM Plex Sans for UI; JetBrains Mono or Fira Code for CLI/code.
- **Logo ideas**: Stylized thread loop forming an “F”; braided cable knot; weave pattern turning into a connector; cable bent into an infinity-like loop. (SVG explorations can be generated on request.)

## CLI Identity

- Command namespace: `filare` (short alias `fil` if desired).
- Sample verbs: `filare weave` (generate/assemble), `filare forge` (schematics), `filare inspect` (validate), `filare loom` (routing diagrams), `filare render` (export), `filare bind` (connect layers), `filare link` (map components), `filare draft` (spec skeleton).

## Ecosystem Naming

- Core tool: Filare Core.
- Possible submodules/plugins: Filare Loom (diagramming), Filare Forge (generator), Filare Specs (schemas), Filare Studio (GUI), Filare Graph (topology), Filare Render (export utilities), Filare Vault (secure config), Filare Mechanica (2D/3D placement).
- File naming: `filare.yml`/`filare.toml`; outputs like `*.fil`, `*.loom`, `*.weave.svg`.

## Voice & Tone

- Calm engineering; minimalist craft; “toolmakers for toolmakers.”
- Sample lines: “Filare weaves your system into coherence.” / “From threads to harness.” / “Design wiring with intention.” / “Precision, structure, and elegant assembly.”

## Use Cases

- Wire harness generation; cable bundle design; connectors and pin mapping; routing/weaving algorithms.
- Digital twin of cable networks; ECS/infra wiring; SOPS/AGE secrets weaving; messaging/service-mesh wiring; Terraform graphing; software component dependency wiring.
