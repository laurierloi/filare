Follow-up features under `docs/features/graph/` elaborate how to refactor Filare models toward a node/link-centric graph. Each file depends on `docs/features/filare-model-graph-base.md` and should be implemented as separate features.

- pins-in-graph.md — Pins as nodes; connectors link to pins; loops as links.
- wires-in-graph.md — Wires/shields as nodes; cables link to wires; pins attach via links.
- colors-in-graph.md — Colors as nodes; components link to shared color nodes.
- connections-in-graph.md — Connections/loops as graph links instead of nested lists.
- connector-cable-connector-in-graph.md — End-to-end attachment chain via graph links.
- bom-from-graph.md — BOM generated by traversing the graph.
- cut-diagram-from-graph.md — Cut diagrams generated by graph traversal.
- termination-diagram-from-graph.md — Termination diagrams generated by graph traversal.
- bundle-model.md — Bundle as a graph node with member links.
- cable-as-part.md — Cable as a part node linking to member wires/shields.
- parts-and-components-links.md — Link component instances to manufactured Part nodes and derive a parts list.
- parts-list-export.md — Reference-only parts list export from graph traversal (no quantities).
- interface/interface-general-idea.md — Interfaces as nodes grouping pins/wires/components for semantic analysis.
- pins-terminations-in-graph.md — Terminations as nodes with pin-to-termination links (splice/crimp/solder).
- pin-ordering-parser.md — Derive connector pin ordering from pin node metadata, not link order.
- render-metadata-separation.md — Separate rendering hints (side/label/visual) from link payloads via dedicated nodes/structures.
