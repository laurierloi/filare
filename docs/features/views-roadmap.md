## Summary

Track legacy view-related tasks from `docs/tasks.md`, including additional diagram/table views and presentation tweaks.

## Scope

- Connection-only view: `230911GTW1_create_a_view_with_only_connection_table`
- Split SVG output: `230329GTW1_support_splitting_SVG_in_two`
- Dual-color wires (ex10): `230717GTW1_support_dual_color_in_wire_see_ex10`
- EGSE template: `230327GTW1_create/include_egse_template`
- Low-level pin table view: `230329GTW1_create_low_level_view_as_only_pin_table`
- High-level connector-only view: `230329GTW2_create_high_level_view_as_only_connector`
- Symbols/icons support: `230329GTW3_support_symbols/icons`

- Cable layering visuals: `230330GTW5_cable_displayed_differently_according_to_layer`

## Proposed Next Steps

1. Triage which views/features are already implemented (e.g., dual-color wires) and mark them done with regressions.
2. Prioritize remaining view tasks; design minimal specs for each.
3. Add examples/regressions as views are delivered; update docs to surface new outputs.
