## Summary

Add optional legend blocks for symbols/colors and standards references to each sheet, aligned with DIN/EN ISO expectations.

## Evidence

- DIN research identifies missing legends and standards reference fields.
- Compliant drawings typically list applicable standards and symbol/color legends.

## Recommended steps

1. Add metadata fields for legends and standards references.
2. Render legend/standards blocks in templates when enabled.
3. Add regression fixtures asserting legend and standards text in outputs.
