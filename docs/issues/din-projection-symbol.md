## Summary

Provide projection symbols (first/third angle) with metadata to select and render the appropriate symbol in Filare outputs.

## Evidence

- DIN research indicates projection symbols are missing from current templates.
- EN ISO/DIN drawings typically show projection method in the title block.

## Recommended steps

1. Add metadata for projection type (first/third angle).
2. Include symbol assets and positioning in templates.
3. Add regression fixture asserting symbol presence/type in rendered outputs.
