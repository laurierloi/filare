DOCUMENTATION

## Evidence

- Legacy tasks (`230327GTW3_create_an_architecture_of_filare`, `230329GTW2_list_features_of_perfect_harness_diagram`) tracked architecture and feature-overview documentation, but had no dedicated issue.
- Architecture docs exist (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/graphs/*`), but need confirmation that they satisfy these tasks.

## Expected Outcome

- Up-to-date architecture overview covering major components, flows, and data models.
- A concise "perfect harness diagram" feature list summarizing capabilities and desired qualities, linked from docs.

## Proposed Next Steps

1. Review current architecture docs (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/graphs/*`) for gaps vs. task intent.
2. Draft/refresh an architecture overview section and a "perfect harness diagram" feature list; link from main docs.
3. Add diagrams or references as needed; ensure content reflects current behavior.
4. Close legacy task entries once covered.
