## Evidence

- Observed in titlepage output: titleblock layout appears improperly formatted (spacing/alignment issues) on the titlepage template.

## Suggested Next Steps

- Reproduce with current examples/titlepage to identify the misalignment in the titleblock.
- Adjust titleblock template/CSS for titlepage context to restore correct spacing/alignment.
- Add a regression test that renders the titlepage and asserts expected structure/positions.
