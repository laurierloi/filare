# UI/UX Index

This section gathers UX and CLI usability reviews: command discoverability, flag ergonomics, template usability, and quantity workflows. Each page should record observations, pain points, and proposed tweaks or experiments.

Use these notes to guide UI polish tasks, track user feedback, and cross-link to issues/features when a change is needed in the CLI, templates, or rendered outputs.

## Current reviews

- CLI ergonomics: [CLI help review](cli-help-review.md) and [CLI subcommand discovery/ergonomics](cli-subcommand-ergonomics.md)
- Quantity workflows: [Quantity workflow UX](quantity-workflow-ux.md)
- Templates and output UX: [Templates overview](templates-overview.md)
